**Steps to run the project locally:**

1. Open XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL.
2. copy the 'northside-cafe' folder and paste into htdocs.
3. Delete the `index.php` file from your htdocs (not from northside cafe).
4. Make sure there is no database named `cafe`.
5. Run the project.

This will automatically create a database named cafe.
If it does not work, there is a sql file attached along with this. Import that sql within your phpmyadmin.
